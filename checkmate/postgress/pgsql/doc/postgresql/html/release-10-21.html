      whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such
      as <code class="literal">tbl.*</code> in contexts other than the top level of
      a <code class="literal">SELECT</code> list) are now always those of the
      associated named composite type, if there is one.  We'd previously
      attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been
      applied to the <code class="literal">FROM</code> entry the variable refers to.
      But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of
      the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be.
      Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up
      to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on
      the whole idea.
     </p><p>      In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns,
      a workaround is to introduce an extra level of
      sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code>, so that the whole-row variable is
      referring to the sub-<code class="literal">SELECT</code>'s output and not to a
      plain table.  Then the variable is of type <code class="type">record</code>
      to begin with and there's no issue.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect output for types <code class="type">timestamptz</code>
      and <code class="type">timetz</code> in <code class="function">table_to_xmlschema()</code>
      and allied functions (Renan Soares Lopes)
     </p><p>      The xmlschema output for these types included a malformed regular
      expression.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid core dump in parser for a <code class="literal">VALUES</code> clause with
      zero columns (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix planner errors for <code class="function">GROUPING()</code> constructs
      that reference outer query levels (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix plan generation for index-only scans on indexes with
      both returnable and non-returnable columns (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The previous coding could try to read non-returnable columns
      in addition to the returnable ones.  This was fairly harmless
      because it didn't actually do anything with the bogus values,
      but it fell foul of a recently-added error check that rejected
      such a plan.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix query-lifespan memory leak in an IndexScan node that is
      performing reordering (Aliaksandr Kalenik)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">ALTER FUNCTION</code> to support changing a
      function's parallelism property and
      its <code class="literal">SET</code>-variable list in the same command (Tom
      Lane)
     </p><p>      The parallelism property change was lost if the same command also
      updated the function's <code class="literal">SET</code> clause.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix mis-sorting of table rows when <code class="command">CLUSTER</code>ing
      using an index whose leading key is an expression (Peter Geoghegan,
      Thomas Munro)
     </p><p>      The table would be rebuilt with the correct data, but in an order
      having little to do with the index order.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix race condition between <code class="command">DROP TABLESPACE</code> and
      checkpointing (Nathan Bossart)
     </p><p>      The checkpoint forced by <code class="command">DROP TABLESPACE</code> could
      sometimes fail to remove all dead files from the tablespace's
      directory, leading to a bogus <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tablespace is not empty</span>”</span>
      error.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible trouble in crash recovery after
      a <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> command that overlaps a checkpoint
      (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Heikki Linnakangas, Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      <code class="command">TRUNCATE</code> must ensure that the table's disk file
      is truncated before the checkpoint is allowed to complete.
      Otherwise, replay starting from that checkpoint might find
      unexpected data in the supposedly-removed pages, possibly causing
      replay failure.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix unsafe toast-data accesses during temporary object cleanup
      (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      Temporary-object deletion during server process exit could fail
      with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FATAL: cannot fetch toast data without an active
      snapshot</span>”</span>.  This was usually harmless since the next use of
      that temporary schema would clean up successfully.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">PANIC: xlog flush request is not satisfied</span>”</span>
      failure during standby promotion when there is a missing WAL
      continuation record (Sami Imseih)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possibility of self-deadlock in hot standby conflict handling
      (Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      With unlucky timing, the WAL-applying process could get stuck
      while waiting for some other process to release a buffer lock.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that logical replication apply workers can be restarted even
      when we're up against
      the <code class="varname">max_sync_workers_per_subscription</code> limit
      (Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      Faulty coding of the limit check caused a restarted worker to exit
      immediately, leaving fewer workers than there should be.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Include unchanged replica identity key columns in the WAL log for an
      update, if they are stored out-of-line (Dilip Kumar, Amit Kapila)
     </p><p>      Otherwise subscribers cannot see the values and will fail to
      replicate the update.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve logical replication subscriber's error message for an
      unsupported relation kind (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      v13 and later servers support publishing partitioned tables.  Older
      server versions cannot handle subscribing to such a table, and they
      gave a very misleading error message: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">table XYZ not found on
      publisher</span>”</span>.  Arrange to deliver a more on-point message.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Disallow execution of SPI functions during PL/Perl function
      compilation (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Perl can be convinced to execute user-defined code during compilation
      of a PL/Perl function.  However, it's not okay for such code to try
      to invoke SQL operations via SPI.  That results in a crash, and if
      it didn't crash it would be a security hazard, because we really
      don't want code execution during function validation.  Put in a
      check to give a friendlier error message instead.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">libpq</span> accept root-owned SSL private
      key files (David Steele)
     </p><p>      This change synchronizes <span class="application">libpq</span>'s rules
      for safe ownership and permissions of SSL key files with the rules
      the server has used since release 9.6.  Namely, in addition to the
      current rules, allow the case where the key file is owned by root
      and has permissions <code class="literal">rw-r-----</code> or less.  This is
      helpful for system-wide management of key files.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> recheck postmaster aliveness
      while waiting for stop/restart/promote actions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> would verify that the postmaster
      is alive as a side-effect of sending the stop or promote signal, but
      then it just naively waited to see the on-disk state change.  If the
      postmaster died uncleanly without having removed its PID file or
      updated the control file, <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> would
      wait until timeout.  Instead make it recheck every so often that the
      postmaster process is still there.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that <code class="filename">contrib/pageinspect</code> functions cope
      with all-zero pages (Michael Paquier)
     </p><p>      This is a legitimate edge case, but the module was mostly unprepared
      for it.  Arrange to return nulls, or no rows, as appropriate; that
      seems more useful than raising an error.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="filename">contrib/pageinspect</code>, add defenses against
      incorrect page <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">special space</span>”</span> contents, tighten checks
      for correct page size, and add some missing checks that an index is
      of the expected type (Michael Paquier, Justin Pryzby, Julien
      Rouhaud)
     </p><p>      These changes make it less likely that the module will crash on bad
      data.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <code class="filename">contrib/postgres_fdw</code>, verify
      that <code class="literal">ORDER BY</code> clauses are safe to ship before
      requesting a remotely-ordered query, and include
      a <code class="literal">USING</code> clause if necessary (Ronan Dunklau)
     </p><p>      This fix prevents situations where the remote server might sort in a
      different order than we intend.  While sometimes that would be only
      cosmetic, it could produce thoroughly wrong results if the remote
      data is used as input for a locally-performed merge join.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Clean up assorted failures under <span class="productname">clang</span>'s
      <code class="literal">-fsanitize=undefined</code> checks (Tom Lane, Andres
      Freund, Zhihong Yu)
     </p><p>      Most of these changes are just for pro-forma compliance with the
      letter of the C and POSIX standards, and are unlikely to have any
      effect on production builds.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix PL/Perl so it builds on C compilers that don't support statements
      nested within expressions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix possible build failure of <span class="application">pg_dumpall</span>
      on Windows, when not using MSVC to build (Andres Freund)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In Windows builds, use <span class="application">gendef</span> instead
      of <span class="application">pexports</span> to build DEF files (Andrew
      Dunstan)
     </p><p>      This adapts the build process to work on recent MSys tool chains.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent extra expansion of shell wildcard patterns in programs built
      under MinGW (Andrew Dunstan)
     </p><p>      For some reason the C library provided by MinGW will expand shell
      wildcard characters in a program's command-line arguments by
      default.  This is confusing, not least because it doesn't happen
      under MSVC, so turn it off.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span>
      release 2022a for DST law changes in Palestine, plus historical

      deletion in a btree index fails to find the page's parent downlink
      (Peter Geoghegan)
     </p><p>      Rather than throwing an error, just log the issue and continue
      without deleting the empty page.  Previously, a buggy operator class
      or corrupted index could indefinitely prevent completion of
      vacuuming of the index, eventually leading to transaction wraparound
      problems.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> tokens that appear
      in a multi-row <code class="literal">VALUES</code> clause of an
      <code class="command">INSERT</code> on an updatable view (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cache lookup failed for
      type</span>”</span> errors, or in older branches even to crashes.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Disallow rules named <code class="literal">_RETURN</code> that are
      not <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This avoids confusion between a view's <code class="literal">ON SELECT</code>
      rule and any other rules it may have.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Repair rare failure of MULTIEXPR_SUBLINK subplans in inherited
      updates (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Use of the syntax <code class="literal">UPDATE tab SET (c1, ...) = (SELECT
      ...)</code> with an inherited or partitioned target table could
      result in failure if the child tables are sufficiently dissimilar.
      This typically manifested as failure of consistency checks in the
      executor; but a crash or incorrect data updates are also possible.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid flattening <code class="literal">FROM</code>-less subqueries when the
      outer query has grouping sets (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to assertion failures or planner errors
      such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">variable not found in subplan target list</span>”</span>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent WAL corruption after a standby promotion (Dilip Kumar,
      Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      When a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> instance performing
      archive recovery (but not using standby mode) is promoted, and the
      last WAL segment that it attempted to read ended in a partial
      record, the instance would write an invalid WAL segment on the new
      timeline.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix mis-ordering of WAL operations in fast insert path for GIN
      indexes (Matthias van de Meent, Zhang Mingli)
     </p><p>      This mistake is not known to have any negative consequences within
      core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, but it did cause issues
      for some extensions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix bugs in logical decoding when replay starts from a point
      between the beginning of a transaction and the beginning of its
      subtransaction (Masahiko Sawada, Kuroda Hayato)
     </p><p>      These errors could lead to assertion failures in debug builds, and
      otherwise to memory leaks.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during
      logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>      If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies
      system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to
      fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Accept interrupts in more places during logical decoding (Amit
      Kapila, Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>      This ameliorates problems with slow shutdown of replication workers.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid crash after function syntax error in replication workers
      (Maxim Orlov, Anton Melnikov, Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If a syntax error occurred in a SQL-language or PL/pgSQL-language
      <code class="command">CREATE FUNCTION</code> or <code class="command">DO</code> command
      executed in a logical replication worker, the worker process would
      crash with a null pointer dereference or assertion failure.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL
      functions (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one
      place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify
      read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would
      observe the wrong value.  (Within
      core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, the expanded-datum
      mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but
      extensions might use it for other structured types.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In Snowball dictionaries, don't try to stem excessively-long words
      (Olly Betts, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If the input word exceeds 1000 bytes, return it as-is after case
      folding, rather than trying to run it through the Snowball code.
      This restriction protects against a known
      recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it
      seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance
      issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers.  Such a long string
      is surely not a word in any human language, so it's doubtful that
      the stemmer would have done anything desirable with it anyway.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix use-after-free hazard in string comparisons (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Improper memory management in the string comparison functions
      could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers,
      potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory
      now.  This would only happen with fairly long strings (more than
      1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent postmaster crash when shared-memory state is corrupted
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The postmaster process is supposed to survive and initiate a
      database restart if shared memory becomes corrupted, but one
      bit of code was being insufficiently cautious about that.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Add some more defenses against recursion till stack overrun
      (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid long-term memory leakage in the autovacuum launcher process
      (Reid Thompson)
     </p><p>      The lack of field reports suggests that this problem is only latent
      in pre-v15 branches; but it's not very clear why, so back-patch the
      fix anyway.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Add missing guards for <code class="literal">NULL</code> connection pointer
      in <span class="application">libpq</span> (Daniele Varrazzo, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      There's a convention that <span class="application">libpq</span> functions
      should check for a NULL PGconn argument, and fail gracefully instead
      of crashing.  <code class="function">PQflush()</code>
      and <code class="function">PQisnonblocking()</code> didn't get that memo, so
      fix them.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">ecpg</span>, fix omission of variable storage
      classes when multiple <code class="type">varchar</code> or <code class="type">bytea</code>
      variables are declared in the same declaration (Andrey Sokolov)
     </p><p>      For example, <span class="application">ecpg</span>
      translated <code class="literal">static varchar str1[10], str2[20],
      str3[30];</code> in such a way that only <code class="varname">str1</code>
      was marked <code class="literal">static</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow cross-platform tablespace relocation
      in <span class="application">pg_basebackup</span> (Robert Haas)
     </p><p>      Allow the remote path in <code class="option">--tablespace-mapping</code> to be
      either a Unix-style or Windows-style absolute path, since the source
      server could be on a different OS than the local system.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">pg_stat_statements</span>, fix access to
      already-freed memory (zhaoqigui)
     </p><p>      This occurred if <span class="application">pg_stat_statements</span>
      tracked a <code class="command">ROLLBACK</code> command issued via extended
      query protocol.  In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion
      failure.  In production builds there would often be no visible ill
      effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely
      result would be to store garbage for the query string.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      In <span class="application">postgres_fdw</span>, ensure that target lists
      constructed for EvalPlanQual plans will have all required columns
      (Richard Guo, Etsuro Fujita)
     </p><p>      This avoids <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">variable not found in subplan target list</span>”</span>
      errors in rare cases.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Reject unwanted output from the platform's
      <code class="function">uuid_create()</code> function (Nazir Bilal Yavuz)
     </p><p>      The <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span> module expects
      libc's <code class="function">uuid_create()</code> to produce a version-1
      UUID, but recent NetBSD releases produce a version-4 (random) UUID
      instead.  Check for that, and complain if so.  Drop the
      documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable
      for <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span>.
      (If a version-4 UUID is okay for your purposes, you don't
      need <span class="application">uuid-ossp</span> at all; just
      use <code class="function">gen_random_uuid()</code>.)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Include new Perl test modules in standard installations
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      Add <code class="filename">PostgreSQL/Test/Cluster.pm</code> and
      <code class="filename">PostgreSQL/Test/Utils.pm</code> to the standard
      installation file set in pre-version-15 branches.  This is for the
      benefit of extensions that want to use newly-written test code in
      older branches.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      On NetBSD, force dynamic symbol resolution at postmaster start
      (Andres Freund, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This avoids a risk of deadlock in the dynamic linker on NetBSD 10.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow use of <code class="function">__sync_lock_test_and_set()</code> for
      spinlocks on any machine (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This eases porting to new machine architectures, at least if you're
      using a compiler that supports this GCC builtin function.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Rename symbol <code class="literal">REF</code> to <code class="literal">REF_P</code> to
      avoid compile failure on recent macOS (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Silence assorted compiler warnings from clang 15 and later (Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Update time zone data files to <span class="application">tzdata</span>
      release 2022f for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Iran, Jordan,
      Mexico, Palestine, and Syria, plus historical corrections for Chile,
      Crimea, Iran, and Mexico.
     </p><p>      Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby,
      more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970:
      Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei,
      Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam,
      Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo,
      Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen,
      Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti,
      Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis.
      (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of
      these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland,
      Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.)  America/Nipigon,
      America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and
      Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after
      discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those
      zones seem to have been errors.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias;
      but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.
     </p><p>      These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for
      the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications
      expecting consistency of <code class="type">timestamptz</code> display.  As an
      example, the stored value <code class="literal">1944-06-01 12:00 UTC</code>
      would previously display as <code class="literal">1944-06-01
      13:00:00+01</code> if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but
      now it will read out as <code class="literal">1944-06-01 14:00:00+02</code>.
     </p><p>      It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that
      will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot
      of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in
      more total changes from the previous release than accepting these
      upstream changes does.  <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> has
      chosen to ship the <span class="productname">tzdb</span> data
      as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating
      system distributions are doing likewise.  However, if these changes
      cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution
      is to install a local build of the time zone data files using
      <span class="productname">tzdb</span>'s backwards-compatibility options
      (see their <code class="literal">PACKRATDATA</code>
      and <code class="literal">PACKRATLIST</code> options).

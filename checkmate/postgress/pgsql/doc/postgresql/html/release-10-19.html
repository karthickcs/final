      encryption handshake (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
      connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
      supposedly encryption-protected database session.
      This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server,
      although that would only work if the server did not demand any
      authentication data.  (However, a server relying on SSL certificate
      authentication might well not do so.)

      This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the

      (CVE-2021-23222)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes
      after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record
      (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the
      rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery
      logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning
      of the incomplete WAL record.  This is problematic since standby
      servers may already have copies of that WAL segment.  They will then
      see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover
      without manual intervention.  To fix, do not back up over a WAL
      segment boundary when restarting after a crash.  Instead write a new
      type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing
      readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and
      must be disregarded.
     </p><p>      When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers
      before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new
      WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to wait for
      the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)
     </p><p>      Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from
      the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such
      rows.  The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account
      for <code class="command">PREPARE TRANSACTION</code> commands that were still
      in progress when <code class="command">CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code>
      checked for them.  As before, in installations that have enabled
      prepared transactions (<code class="varname">max_prepared_transactions</code>
      &gt; 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes
      in case this problem occurred when they were built.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid race condition that can cause backends to fail to add entries
      for new rows to an index being built concurrently (Noah Misch,
      Andrey Borodin)
     </p><p>      While it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially
      affect any index built or reindexed with
      the <code class="literal">CONCURRENTLY</code> option.  It is recommended to
      reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <code class="type">float4</code> and <code class="type">float8</code> hash functions to
      produce uniform results for NaNs (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Since <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>'s floating-point types
      deem all NaNs to be equal, it's important for the hash functions to
      produce the same hash code for all bit-patterns that are NaNs
      according to the IEEE 754 standard.  This failed to happen before,
      meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce
      incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values.
      (<code class="literal">'-NaN'::float8</code> is one way to produce such a
      value on most machines.)  It is advisable to reindex hash indexes
      on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they
      might contain such values.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent data loss during crash recovery of <code class="command">CREATE
      TABLESPACE</code>, when <code class="varname">wal_level</code>
      = <code class="literal">minimal</code> (Noah Misch)
     </p><p>      If the server crashed between <code class="command">CREATE TABLESPACE</code>
      and the next checkpoint, replay would fully remove the contents of
      the new tablespace's directory, relying on subsequent WAL replay
      to restore everything within that directory.  This interacts badly
      with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example
      is <code class="command">COPY</code> into a just-created table).  Such
      optimizations are applied only when <code class="varname">wal_level</code>
      is <code class="literal">minimal</code>, which is not the default in v10 and
      later.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated for a table being
      attached to or detached from a partitioned table (Amit Langote,
      Álvaro Herrera)
     </p><p>      This oversight could allow misbehavior of subsequent inserts/updates
      addressed directly to the partition, but only in currently-existing
      sessions.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated when creating or
      dropping a <code class="literal">FOR ALL TABLES</code> publication
      (Hou Zhijie, Vignesh C)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to improper replication behavior until all
      currently-existing sessions have exited.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Don't discard a cast to the same type with unspecified type modifier
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      For example, if column <code class="literal">f1</code> is of
      type <code class="literal">numeric(18,3)</code>, the parser used to simply
      discard a cast like <code class="literal">f1::numeric</code>, on the grounds
      that it would have no run-time effect.  That's true, but the exposed
      type of the expression should still be considered to be
      plain <code class="literal">numeric</code>,
      not <code class="literal">numeric(18,3)</code>.  This is important for
      correctly resolving the type of larger constructs, such
      as recursive <code class="literal">UNION</code>s.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Disallow creating an ICU collation if the current database's
      encoding won't support it (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Previously this was allowed, but then the collation could not be
      referenced because of the way collation lookup works; you could not
      use the collation, nor even drop it.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix corner-case loss of precision in
      numeric <code class="function">power()</code> (Dean Rasheed)
     </p><p>      The result could be inaccurate when the first argument is very close
      to 1.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid regular expression errors with capturing parentheses
      inside <code class="literal">{0}</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Regular expressions like <code class="literal">(.){0}...\1</code> drew
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">invalid backreference number</span>”</span>.  Other regexp engines
      such as Perl don't complain, though, and for that matter ours
      doesn't either in some closely related cases.  Worse, it could throw
      an assertion failure instead.  Fix it so that no error is thrown and
      instead the back-reference is silently deemed to never match.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent regular expression back-references from sometimes matching
      when they shouldn't (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The regexp engine was careless about clearing match data
      for capturing parentheses after rejecting a partial match.  This
      could allow a later back-reference to match in places where it
      should fail for lack of a defined referent.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix regular expression performance bug with back-references inside
      iteration nodes (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Incorrect back-tracking logic could result in exponential time spent
      looking for a match.  Fortunately the problem is masked in most
      cases by other optimizations.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect results from <code class="literal">AT TIME ZONE</code> applied
      to a <code class="type">time with time zone</code> value (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The results were incorrect if the target time zone was specified by
      a dynamic timezone abbreviation (that is, one that is defined as
      equivalent to a full time zone name, rather than a fixed UTC offset).
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid using MCV-only statistics to estimate the range of a column
      (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      There are corner cases in which <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> will
      build a most-common-values (MCV) list but not a histogram, even
      though the MCV list does not account for all the observed values.
      In such cases, keep the planner from using the MCV list alone to
      estimate the range of column values.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Clean up correctly if a transaction fails after exporting its
      snapshot (Dilip Kumar)
     </p><p>      This oversight would only cause a problem if the same session
      attempted to export a snapshot again.  The most likely scenario for
      that is creation of a replication slot (followed by rollback)
      and then creation of another replication slot.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent wraparound of overflowed-subtransaction tracking on standby
      servers (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Alexander Korotkov)
     </p><p>      This oversight could cause significant performance degradation
      (manifesting as excessive SubtransSLRU traffic) on standby servers.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that prepared transactions are properly accounted for during
      promotion of a standby server (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)
     </p><p>      There was a narrow window where a prepared transaction could be
      omitted from a snapshot taken by a concurrently-running session.
      If that session then used the snapshot to perform data updates,
      erroneous results or data corruption could occur.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix detection of a relation that has grown to the maximum allowed
      length (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      An attempt to extend a table or index past the limit of 2^32-1
      blocks was rejected, but not soon enough to prevent inconsistent
      internal state from being created.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Correctly track the presence of data-modifying CTEs when expanding
      a <code class="literal">DO INSTEAD</code> rule (Greg Nancarrow, Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      The previous failure to do this could lead to problems such as
      unsafely choosing a parallel plan.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect reporting of permissions failures on extended
      statistics objects (Tomas Vondra)
     </p><p>      The code typically produced <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cache lookup error</span>”</span> rather
      than the intended message.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix incorrect snapshot handling in parallel workers (Greg Nancarrow)
     </p><p>      This oversight could lead to misbehavior in parallel queries if the
      transaction isolation level is less than <code class="literal">REPEATABLE
      READ</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that walreceiver processes create all required archive
      notification files before exiting (Fujii Masao)
     </p><p>      If a walreceiver exited exactly at a WAL segment boundary, it failed
      to make a notification file for the last-received segment, thus
      delaying archiving of that segment on the standby.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid trying to lock the <code class="literal">OLD</code>
      and <code class="literal">NEW</code> pseudo-relations in a rule
      that uses <code class="literal">SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>
      (Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix parser's processing of aggregate <code class="literal">FILTER</code>
      clauses (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If the <code class="literal">FILTER</code> expression is a plain boolean column,
      the semantic level of the aggregate could be mis-determined, leading
      to not-per-spec behavior.  If the <code class="literal">FILTER</code>
      expression is itself a boolean-returning aggregate, an error should
      be thrown but was not, likely resulting in a crash at execution.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Avoid null-pointer-dereference crash when dropping a role that owns
      objects being dropped concurrently (Álvaro Herrera)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Prevent <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">snapshot reference leak</span>”</span> warning
      when <code class="function">lo_export()</code> or a related function fails
      (Heikki Linnakangas)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Ensure that scans of SP-GiST indexes are counted in the statistics
      views (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      Incrementing the number-of-index-scans counter was overlooked in the
      SP-GiST code, although per-tuple counters were advanced correctly.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Recalculate relevant wait intervals
      if <code class="varname">recovery_min_apply_delay</code> is changed during
      recovery (Soumyadeep Chakraborty, Ashwin Agrawal)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix infinite loop if a <code class="filename">simplehash.h</code> hash table
      reaches 2^32 elements (Yura Sokolov)
     </p><p>      It seems unlikely that this bug has been hit in practice, as it
      would require <code class="varname">work_mem</code> settings of hundreds of
      gigabytes for existing uses of <code class="filename">simplehash.h</code>.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Reduce memory consumption during calculation of extended statistics
      (Justin Pryzby, Tomas Vondra)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">ecpg</span> to recover correctly
      after <code class="function">malloc()</code> failure while establishing a
      connection (Michael Paquier)
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Allow <code class="literal">EXIT</code> out of the outermost block in a
      PL/pgSQL routine (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      If the routine does not require an explicit <code class="literal">RETURN</code>,
      this usage should be valid, but it was rejected.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Remove <span class="application">pg_ctl</span>'s hard-coded limits on the
      total length of generated commands (Phil Krylov)
     </p><p>      For example, this removes a restriction on how many command-line
      options can be passed through to the postmaster.  Individual path
      names that <span class="application">pg_ctl</span> deals with, such as the
      postmaster executable's name or the data directory name, are still
      limited to <code class="literal">MAXPGPATH</code> bytes in most cases.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Fix <span class="application">pg_dump</span> to dump non-global default
      privileges correctly (Neil Chen, Masahiko Sawada)
     </p><p>      If a global (unrestricted) <code class="command">ALTER DEFAULT
      PRIVILEGES</code> command revoked some present-by-default
      privilege, for example <code class="literal">EXECUTE</code> for functions, and
      then a restricted <code class="command">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</code>
      command granted that privilege again for a selected role or
      schema, <span class="application">pg_dump</span> failed to dump the
      restricted privilege grant correctly.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Make <span class="application">pg_dump</span> acquire shared lock on
      partitioned tables that are to be dumped (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      This oversight was usually pretty harmless, since
      once <span class="application">pg_dump</span> has locked any of the leaf
      partitions, that would suffice to prevent significant DDL on the
      partitioned table itself.  However problems could ensue when dumping
      a childless partitioned table, since no relevant lock would be held.
     </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>      Improve <span class="application">pg_dump</span>'s performance by avoiding
      making per-table queries for RLS policies, and by avoiding repetitive
      calls to <code class="function">format_type()</code> (Tom Lane)
     </p><p>      These changes provide only marginal improvement when dumping from a
      local server, but a dump from a remote server can benefit
      substantially due to fewer network round-trips.

      updated only fitfully; unsurprisingly, it contained a number of
      errors as well as omissions of recently-added zones.  It turns out
      that CLDR has been tracking the most appropriate mappings, so start
      using their data.  This change will not affect any existing
      installation, only newly-initialized clusters.

      release 2021e for DST law changes in Fiji, Jordan, Palestine, and
      Samoa, plus historical corrections for Barbados, Cook Islands,
      Guyana, Niue, Portugal, and Tonga.
     </p><p>      Also, the Pacific/Enderbury zone has been renamed to Pacific/Kanton.
      Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous
      zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Africa/Accra,
      America/Atikokan, America/Blanc-Sablon, America/Creston,
      America/Curacao, America/Nassau, America/Port_of_Spain,
      Antarctica/DumontDUrville, and Antarctica/Syowa.
      In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias.
